# What is WTE?
An all-in-one realtime editor for updating of Windows Terminal settings. This gif is showing wt-editor-cli, a prototype of wte written in node.js. The goal is to create an .exe that can run either as a cli or host a local static serve and use [json-editor](https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor) to function as a gui.
